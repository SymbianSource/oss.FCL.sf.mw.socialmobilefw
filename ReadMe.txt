Dependencies:
==============================================================================
SMF is built on Nokia_Symbian3_SDK_v0.8 and Qt 4.6.3. 
You would need to install qt-mobility-symbian-opensource-1.0.0. 
To enable building of SMF in public SDK, the unified key store (RSA Signing) related code is 
blocked with compiler switch. Use Symbian^3 PDK if you want to enable this feature.

Main Interfaces that can be tested end-to-end using this set-up are ContactsFetcher and 
SmfPost. Though framework code is available, plugins are yet to be available for other service 
interfaces for end-to-end testing.

Limitations:
==============================================================================
1. Support for Non-Symbian (Desktop) version of Qt is not supported at this moment.
2. Integration of Authentication Application with Credential Manager is not complete at the moment. 
    So sample plugins require some hacks to access application information for Facebook and Flickr. 
    Please see pre-build step 2 on how to achieve this.
3. SMFSettingsUI is not complete at this moment. This impacts network proxy settings. See pre-build
    step 1 on how to overcome this.

Pre-build steps:
==============================================================================
1. SMF uses QNetwork classes to setup proxy-settings. For testing on emulator (WINSCW), find the 
    hardcoded value under compiler switch "EMULATORTESTING" in file smftransportmanagerutil.cpp. 
    If your proxy requires authentication, provide "<username> space <password>" in plaintext in a file 
    "DoNotShare.txt" and place this file in "C:/Data/" - which is at "\epoc32\winscw\c\data" under your 
    SDK installation folder. You are good to go now.


Building Steps :  - 
==============================================================================
1. Use smfrepo.pro present in top level to build. This single pro file builds SmfServer, SmfCredMgr, SmfClient,
Sample Plugins and Sample TestApp
2. To test on emulator (WINSCW) you can run smfclientapp.exe.
3. QJson requires high capability, so testing on device would require appropriate cerificatres for signing. 
see https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page

Running Sample Application
==============================================================================
1. Run AuthApp - this would authenticate to Facebook.
2. Run Flickr Auth App - this would authenticate to Flickr.
3.Run project from \example\DemoGui. This should fetch names of the friends from facebook [for the user who
provided the keys in step 2 in pre-build steps] and pictures from Flickr
4. The results might not show properly on UI due to problems in S^3 SDK for Webkit. However textual result can be viewed
at the generated log file - \epoc32\winscw\c\data\SmfLogs.txt

	smfcredmgrcommon.h
	
	
Observed Dependencies
==============================================================================
The authentication applications are loading web pages through Qt Webkit and hence its performance depends 
on your network speed and response from the service provider. So if the page taken time to load please be 
patient enough till loading is completed.



Using Test Applications
==============================================================================
1) For testing individual interfaces, build the test applications provided (they are console bases applications). 
Start the eshell and start individual application from eshell.

2) For using test applications used to test SMF from Multiple client application, use the CrossTest1 and CrossTest2 
applications. Build both and from the emulator start CrossTest1.exe (which in turn will send the request and 
starts CrossTest2 immediately after sending the request to SMF.
